.. _Add Binary Data to a Patch:

Add Binary Data to a Patch
==========================

Description
-----------
  Since it is not desirable to add large binary files to the Git repository
  history, they are handled in a special way.  This session demonstrates how to
  add binary data like image files to a Gerrit patch.
  
More information
----------------

A brief description of the CMake/hash system that prevents
bloat in our Git history is given.  More written information on using the `ITK
Git/Gerrit/CMake system for large image or binary data
<http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK/Git/Develop/Data>`_ can be found on the Wiki.
