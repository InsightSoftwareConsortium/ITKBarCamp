Welcome to the ITK Bar Camp
===========================

Introduction
------------

This is a training ground for `The Next Generation`_ of ITK_ Community Members.

The Insight Toolkit (ITK_) is a medical image analysis toolkit written in C++
that has wrappings for many other languages.  This page contains supporting
material and archives of ITK Bar Camp Hangouts where members gather to discuss
topics such as community contribution, programming in C++, image processing and
analysis theory and practice, quality software practices, and working with ITK.

To take part in the hangouts, follow the `ITK Bar Camp Google+ page`_ with your
Google+ profile.  Planned hangouts will be posted there and the ITK mailing
lists.  If you are following the `ITK Bar Camp Google+ page`_, you will receive
invitations to the hangouts.
