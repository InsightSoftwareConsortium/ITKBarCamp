Training grounds for Next Generation of ITK Community Members

This repository hosts materials used for training a new generation of ITK
community members.

It includes tutorials on the topics that are the basic culture of an ITK
community member, including:

* Community Software Process
* C++ Programming
* Software Quality Assurance
* Image Processing

The materials are a combination of short webinars (inspired by the Kahn Academy
style), short tutorials and focused source code examples.

It is expected that new community members will walk through these materials at
their own pace, and also contribute to them.
